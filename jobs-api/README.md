# Jobs API

Here you can review the api [https://jobs-api-06-murtcay.herokuapp.com/](https://jobs-api-06-murtcay.herokuapp.com/)

In order to run the project, setup .env and set MONGO_URI variable equal to DB connection string.

In order to avoid port collisions, in the source code port value is 5000.  

If you use different port number do not forget the change it from the url in swagger-ui.yaml.
